                        <p>Digital Consulting Group LLC is a marketing and lead generation platform that connects
                            consumers with third-party lenders and financial service providers. We do not provide loans,
                            make credit decisions, or offer financial products directly. Instead, we receive
                            compensation from lenders and other financial partners in exchange for providing consumer
                            loan inquiries (“leads”) to them. This website is not an offer or solicitation to lend and
                            does not guarantee loan approval, specific terms, or available loan amounts.</p>

                        <p><a href="#" class="aul__btn">Find Loan Options</a></p>

                        <h4><strong>1. How Loan Offers Are Ranked</strong></h4>
                        <p>Loan offers presented on this website are displayed based on a combination of factors,
                            including lender compensation, loan terms, consumer eligibility, and compliance with
                            regulatory guidelines. While compensation may influence lender visibility, Digital
                            Consulting Group LLC does not guarantee that consumers will receive the best rates or terms
                            from a specific lender.</p>

                        <h4><strong>2. Estimated APR Range Disclosure</strong></h4>
                        <p>Loan terms and APRs vary based on lender policies and borrower qualifications. While Digital
                            Consulting Group LLC does not set loan terms, the typical APR range for short-term loans may
                            vary from 5.99% to 35.99% or higher, depending on creditworthiness and state regulations.
                            Each lender provides specific APR disclosures before loan agreement finalization.</p>

                        <h4><strong>3. Advertising & Compensation Disclosure</strong></h4>
                        <p>This website earns revenue through advertising relationships with lenders, loan aggregators,
                            and financial service providers. Compensation received may impact the placement, ranking, or
                            visibility of loan offers on this website. However, compensation does not influence which
                            lenders a consumer is connected with, as loan matching is based on lender requirements and
                            the consumer’s provided information.</p>
                        <p>We do not endorse, recommend, or guarantee any particular lender or financial service
                            provider, nor do we control the loan terms or conditions offered to consumers. Users should
                            always compare multiple loan options and carefully review all lender disclosures before
                            agreeing to any loan terms.</p>

                        <h4><strong>4. No Endorsement or Guarantee</strong></h4>
                        <p>The presence of lenders or loan offers on this website does not constitute an endorsement of
                            any particular lender or financial product. Digital Consulting Group LLC does not guarantee
                            that you will be approved for a loan, that you will receive a specific loan amount, or that
                            you will qualify for favorable interest rates or repayment terms. Loan approval and loan
                            terms are determined solely by the participating lenders, based on their internal criteria,
                            creditworthiness evaluations, and applicable state and federal lending laws.</p>

                        <h4><strong>5. Third-Party Lender Responsibility & Consumer Choice</strong></h4>
                        <p>All loan offers are provided by independent third-party lenders who have their own terms,
                            conditions, disclosures, and privacy policies. Digital Consulting Group LLC is not
                            responsible for lender actions, loan decisions, interest rates, fees, or repayment terms.
                            Any agreements entered into between users and lenders are solely between those parties.
                            Users are encouraged to carefully read and understand all loan agreements, disclosures, and
                            applicable terms before accepting any loan offer.</p>

                        <h4><strong>6. Compliance with Lending Regulations</strong></h4>
                        <p>Digital Consulting Group LLC adheres to federal and state lending and marketing regulations,
                            including but not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Truth in Lending Act (TILA) – Ensuring transparency in loan terms, APR disclosures, and
                                repayment conditions.</li>
                            <li>Fair Lending Practices – Compliance with Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and state
                                consumer lending protections.</li>
                            <li>Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Guidelines – Preventing deceptive or misleading
                                advertising practices.</li>
                            <li>Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAAP) Regulations – Ensuring fair and
                                transparent marketing.</li>
                            <li>State-Specific Lending Laws – Compliance with state-imposed interest rate caps, loan
                                term limits, and borrower protections where applicable.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4><strong>7. Loan Terms & APR Disclosure</strong></h4>
                        <p>Loan terms and APRs vary by lender and borrower qualifications. The APR represents the cost
                            of credit as a yearly rate and includes interest rates and applicable fees. APR ranges,
                            repayment periods, and loan amounts will be disclosed to you by your lender before you sign
                            any agreement. Loan rates and terms are subject to state laws, lender policies, and
                            creditworthiness assessments. Late or missed payments may result in additional fees or
                            adverse effects on your credit score.</p>

                        <h4><strong>8. Marketing & Advertising Claims</strong></h4>
                        <p>Digital Consulting Group LLC prohibits misleading or deceptive marketing claims, including
                            but not limited to:</p>

                            <li>“Guaranteed Approval” – We do not guarantee loan approval, and all approvals are subject
                                to lender review.</li>
                            <li>“Instant Funds” – Loan disbursement times vary by lender and state regulations.</li>
                            <li>“Lowest Interest Rates” – Interest rates vary and depend on lender policies,
                                creditworthiness, and applicable laws.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you encounter any misleading statements on this website or in third-party marketing
                            related to our services, please report them immediately to ensure compliance with FTC, CFPB,
