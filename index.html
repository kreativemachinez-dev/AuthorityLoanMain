              <p><strong>Consumer Risk Disclosure</strong></p>
              <p>
                Borrowing money through short-term and installment loans carries financial risks. High-interest loans
                may not be suitable for all borrowers, and failure to repay may result in additional fees, collection
                efforts, or negative impacts on your credit score. Before accepting any loan offer, carefully review the
                lender’s terms, repayment schedule, and total loan cost to ensure it aligns with your financial
                situation. If you are facing financial hardship, consider exploring alternative lending options or
                consulting a financial advisor.
              </p>
              <p><strong>APR Variation Notice</strong></p>
              <p>
                The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for loans varies depending on lender policies, state regulations,
                creditworthiness, and loan terms. APRs typically range from 5.99% to 35.99%, but actual APRs may be
                higher or lower depending on lender policies, loan duration, borrower creditworthiness, state
                regulations, and additional factors. Lenders are required by law to disclose the exact APR, all fees,
                repayment schedules, and total loan cost before you agree to the loan.
